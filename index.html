<p><h2>Central African Republic: Referendum result gives green light to president for third term</h2></p>
    <p>Issued on: 09/08/2023 - 12:36</p>
<p class="note1">The President of the Central African Republic, Faustin Archange Touadéra, could run for another term. The draft of a new constitution was approved by more than 95% in the referendum held on 30 July. There was little suspense, as the opposition had widely called for a boycott of the referendum. It accused the Head of State of wanting to remain in power "for life". FRANCE 24's correspondent Justice Baidoo reports from Accra in Ghana.</p>

  <p>The United States is seeking to prevent Russia from scoring a major new win with coup-hit Niger, wagering despite initial disappointment that long-standing military ties will keep the country in the Western orbit. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of State, has said that Russia and Wagner stands to gain from this turmoil. FRANCE 24's international affairs editor Oliver Farry gives his analysis.</p>

<p>Niger's military junta has refused the latest diplomatic attempt to reinstall the country's ousted president Mohamed Bazoum. Military leaders rejected attempts by US officials on Monday and said a firm No to a proposed visit by ECOWAS representatives the African Union and the UN. In the meantime Niger has been slapped with more sanctions. West African leaders are to hold a further summit on the crisis on Thursday.

    <p>Some 4.3 million people in Niger are need of aid according to the UN – a figure that is set to rise as international sanctions come into effect following the military coup on July 26. The junta’s decision on Sunday to close Niger’s airspace is further reducing access to aid, UN humanitarian coordinator for Niger Louise Aubin told FRANCE 24. “This has certainly interrupted some of our humanitarian operations given that we’re so reliant on having to cover vast space – it’s a huge country.” FRANCE 24's Laurent Berstecher tells us more.</p>

<p><h2>Does the coup in Niger threaten nuclear power plants in France?</h2></p>
<p>BLOG POST | Issued on: 01/08/2023 - 20:41
7 min ago</p>
<p>Due to a long-standing policy that dates back to ex-president Charles de Gaulle, France derives about 70 percent of its electricity from nuclear energy, more than any other country. France is also the world's largest net exporter of nuclear energy, bringing in more than €3 billion per year.

    But the military coup in Niger last week – and unconfirmed reports that the West African country intends to suspend uranium supplies to France – have raised questions over what role the industry should play in France’s future. 
    
    The reports led some opposition politicians in France to question the role of nuclear power in France’s energy portfolio, notably given French President Emmanuel Macron’s repeated calls for “energy independence”.   “Niger supplies France with the uranium it needs for its nuclear power plants … Reminder: nuclear power does not make for energy independence,” said Sandrine Rousseau, a left-wing Green politician on X (formerly Twitter) July 29. Niger has maintained a market share of between 4 and 6 percent of the global uranium trade for the last decade, according to the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency (NEA).</p>

    <p>The situation in Niger remained fluid on Thursday, a day after members of the presidential guard detained President Mohamed Bazoum at the presidential palace in Niamey. FRANCE 24 spoke with Danielle Resnick, a political scientist specialising in sub-Saharan Africa at the Brookings Institution, about how a military coup could affect Niger’s relations with regional and Western allies, and what it might mean for Russian influence on the African continent.
        <p>Niger’s army command on Thursday declared its support for a rebellion launched a day earlier by members of the presidential guard, saying its priority is to avoid destabilising the country. In a statement on behalf of military command, General Abdou Sidikou Issa said it "has decided to subscribe to the declaration made by the Defence and Security Forces …</p>

FRANCE 24 looks back on four little-known Soviet operations aimed at furthering Russian interests in Africa during the Cold War
    <p>The full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 reignited an old battle for global influence between Russia and the West that has also put Africa in the spotlight.</p>

    <p>The son of Niger's ambassador to France has been detained in Niamey, the ambassador told journalists on Wednesday. It is unclear whether he was taken into custody due to his involvement in an ongoing anti-corruption case or to his mother's refusal to follow the military junta’s orders and quit her role.
