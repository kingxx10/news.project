The investigation, dubbed "Operation Jackal", was led by law enforcement agencies in May across 21 countries in six continents and targeted cybercrime groups such as Nigerian criminal gang "Black Axe," the international policing organisation said in a statement.

"No matter where they hide in cyberspace, INTERPOL will pursue them relentlessly," Isaac Kehinde Oginni, director of Interpol's Financial Crime and Anti-corruption Centre (IFCACC), said of the criminal groups.

Between 15 and 29 May, 2.15 million euros were frozen or seized, 103 people were arrested, 1,110 suspects were identified and 208 bank accounts were blocked.
A similar operation took place in 2022 and resulted in the interception of 1.2 million euros and 75 arrests.

<h4>Inflation rate: Nigeria doing better than other African countries – CBN</h4>
<img src="https://cdn.vanguardngr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CBN-SHonubi-Acting.jpg" alt="width=300" height="300">
<p>The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN said the country’s inflation rate is still doing better than most African nations.
    The acting Governor of the CBN, Folashodun Shonubi, stated this at the 2023 Zenith Bank International Trade Seminar in Lagos on Tuesday.
    </p>
<p>According to him, there were several contributing factors to the global inflation rise.</p>
<p>Speaking on the theme, “Nigerian Non-Oil Export Industry. The Present, The Future,” Shonubi expressed concern over low growth rate in non-oil exports to Gross Domestic Product ratio.

The acting CBN governor, who was represented by the Deputy Governor, Economic Policy at the CBN, Kingsley Obiorah, said Nigeria’s inflation rate stood at 22.8 per cent, adding that the International Monetary Fund expected the country to have a growth moderation of 3.2 per cent in 2023.</p>
<p>Obiorah stated, “Now, when you come down to Africa and neighbouring Ghana, At the last count inflation there is at 42.5 per cent. We have it at 31 per cent in Ethiopia and 36 per cent in Egypt.
“So, in our dear country, we are at 22.8 per cent. When you hear these figures, it tells you that we’re not doing as badly but all of this has also affected economic growth itself. Today, the IMF has revised growth downwards from 3.5% per cent to three per cent this year and 3 per cent next year.”</p>
<p>He added, “For Sub-Saharan Africa, they expect growth to moderate from 4.1 per cent last year to 3.5 per cent this year, but to take back again to just slightly over 4 v next year. In Nigeria they expect us to do 3.2 per cent this year.”

    Obiorah mentioned that the war between Russia and Ukraine, and a shift from goods to services are also significant factors.
    
    “We know that the war between Russia and Ukraine is contributing a lot as the two countries are very important commodity exporters. Both of them account for 30 per cent of sunflower exports in the world. So, when such a region is at war, you know what will happen to food prices worldwide.</p>
