Niger's military junta has refused the latest diplomatic attempt to reinstall the country's ousted president Mohamed Bazoum. Military leaders rejected attempts by US officials on Monday and said a firm No to a proposed visit by ECOWAS representatives the African Union and the UN. In the meantime Niger has been slapped with more sanctions. West African leaders are to hold a further summit on the crisis on Thursday. FRANCE 24's international affairs editor Oliver Farry gives his analysis.

<p>"Your Excellencies, Heads of State and Government;</p>

<p>"Your Excellency, the President of the ECOWAS Commission;</p>
<p>"Your Excellency, President of the African Union Commission;</p>
<p>Your Excellency, President of the UEMOA Commission;</p>

   <p>The Special Representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations in West Africa and the Sahel; and</p>
<p>Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
<p>Let me commence by welcoming you all to the Second (2nd) Extraordinary Summit on the Socio-Political Situation in the Republic of Niger, within the space of ten days. Your presence here, despite the short notice, demonstrates the unwavering dedication of our esteemed community to finding a lasting solution to the political situation in the Republic of Niger.
    Today, we gather with a profound sense of urgency and firm determination, building upon the commitments made during our first Extraordinary Summit, on the grave political crisis befalling our sister nation. During that initial meeting, we voiced our solidarity with the people of Niger and their democratically elected President, H.E Mohamed Bazoum, by condemning the military take over and the unjust detention of their democratically elected President.</p>
<p>"Your Excellencies, Distinguished Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>As you may recall, we called on the junta to rescind its decision of toppling a legitimate government. We proceeded to impose sanctions with the hope that this resolute measure would serve as a catalyst for the restoration of the constitutional order in Niger. Regrettably, the seven-day ultimatum we issued during the first Summit has not yielded the desired outcome. We have also made diligent efforts through the deployment of various ECOWAS mediation teams, to engage the military junta for a peaceful resolution of the political situation. One of the facilitators, former Head of State of Nigeria, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, would update us on the outcome of his mission to Niamey.
    Similarly, as part of a coherent diplomatic initiatives, Special Envoys were dispatched to non-ECOWAS nations, particularly Libya and Algeria. During these engagements, the Envoy designated for Libya had the privilege of an audience with the President of Libya. This discourse resulted in an unequivocal expression of support for the resolutions adopted by ECOWAS aimed at restoring constitutional governance in Niger. In Algeria, the Envoy was received by the Minister of Foreign Affairs on behalf of the President of the country. These initiatives are aimed at presenting a cohesive and united stance regarding the ongoing circumstances in Niger, thus showing a collaborative and concerted approach among African nations
</p>
<p>Following the resolution of our previous Extraordinary Summit to initiate a meeting of the ECOWAS Chiefs of Defense Staff, the meeting of the Chiefs of Staff Committee was duly held from 2nd to 4thAugust, 2023. The outcome of that meeting, as well as a Memorandum by the President of the ECOWAS Commission on current socio-political developments in Niger, will be presented during this Summit. These will offer critical insights that will inform our collective decision-making process at this meeting.</p>
