<p>President Mohamed Bazoum of Niger Republic</p>

<p>President Quattara stated this while speaking with journalists at the Extraordinary Summit of Economic Community of West African States, ECOWAS Heads of State and Government on the crisis in Niger.

    Recall that the leader of Niger’s Presidential Brigade Guard, General Abduouramane Tchiani had overthrown the democratically elected President, Muhamad Bazoum and the ECOWAS has ordered that the military should reinstate him.</p>
<p>Speaking to journalists, before he left the Summit, he said, “We had a very good summit. We thank President Tinubu for having invited us, for his hospitality and the people of Nigeria.

    “As you’re aware this is the second summit in 10 days that we have organized on Niger and this is a critical problem we have to solve. As you’re aware, ECOWAS has taken many decisions in the past, legal and factual about coup d’etat and the community has always condemned coup d’etat and coup d’etat have happened in many countries in the sub-region.</p>
<p>“ECOWAS has intervened in the past in Liberia, Sierra Leone recently in Gambia, Guinea Bissau and today we have a similar situation in Niger.

    “I’d like to say that ECOWAS cannot accept this. This is not a matter of Nigeria against Niger, not at all. The decision that we have made today and I hope it would be implemented immediately is a decision of ECOWAS, all heads of state, I think that we have tried dialogue with the putschists.
    
    “We have sent delegation, high personalities like former president Abdulsalami Abubakar, the Sultan of Sokoto, Emir of Kano, former governor of CBN Sanusi my friend and many others personalities in this important country, to talk the people of Niger.
