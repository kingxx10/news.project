    <h3>12:18pm: Son of Niger ambassador to France detained in Niamey</h3>
    <p>The son of Niger's ambassador to France, Idrissa Kané, has been detained in Niamey, the ambassador told AFP on Wednesday.

        Kané is general manager of Niger’s Post Office and involved in a case of alleged misappropriation of public funds being handled by the Niger’s anti-corruption body, Halcia.
        
        It is unclear whether he was taken into custody due to this case or to his mother's defiant attitude towards Niger’s new military leaders.
        
        Ambassador Aïchatou Boulama Kané has remained in her post despite a declaration from the coup leaders on Thursday that it was "terminating" roles for Niger's ambassadors to France, the United States, Nigeria and Togo.
        
        Ambassador Kané told AFP on Friday that she was "still the ambassador of the legitimate President Bazoum Mohamed". She said the decision to terminate her role was "null and void, it was taken by an illegitimate power. I am the ambassador of Niger in France”.</p>
