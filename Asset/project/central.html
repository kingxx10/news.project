<p>The President of the Central African Republic, Faustin Archange Touadéra, could run for another term. The draft of a new constitution was approved by more than 95% in the referendum held on 30 July. There was little suspense, as the opposition had widely called for a boycott of the referendum. It accused the Head of State of wanting to remain in power "for life". FRANCE 24's correspondent Justice Baidoo reports from Accra in Ghana.</p>
<p>The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Thursday, deferred till August 22, hearing of the suit the Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philip Shuaibu, filed to halt the alleged plot to impeach him from office.</p>
<p>However, the court, in a ruling by Justice Ahmed Mohammed, restated the order it made on August 4, which mandated all the parties in the suit to maintain status quo ante bellum, pending the hearing and determination of the case.</p>
<p>Cited as 1st to 5th defendants in the suit marked: FHC/ABJ/ CS/1027/2023, are; the Inspector General of Police, State Security Service, Governor of Edo state, Godwin Obaseki, Speaker of Edo State House of Assembly and the Chief Judge of Edo State. 
At the resumed proceedings in the matter on Thursday, whereas the 1st Defendant, IGP, was not represented by a lawyer, the 2nd Defendant, SSS, through its lawyer, Mr. I. Harold, told the court that it had yet to file any process to show cause why reliefs the deputy governor is seeking in the suit should not be granted.</p>
<p>He contended that the Edo state deputy governor was wrong to join the security agency as a party in the suit.

    Besides, Herold, told the court that the agency has filed a counter affidavit to challenge the competence of the main suit.<br>
    
    “We are contending that we ought not have been brought before this court in the first place.<br>
    
    “That is why we did not find it necessary to show cause as we have no business in this matter. We are waiting for the substantive application,”counsel to the 2nd Defendant added.
